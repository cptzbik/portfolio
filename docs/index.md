# Michał Kotowski

Data Scientist | AI Developer | ML Engineer

My name is Michał Kotowski. For almost a year, I have been developing my passion for data analysis, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, consistently building both theoretical knowledge and practical experience in data science projects. I am particularly interested in using data to create solutions that support real business processes – from exploratory data analysis, through predictive modeling, to deploying ML and AI models in practice.

Recently, I became a member of the Masterclass group, where I collaborate on creating modern solutions based on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and advanced data analytics. Participation in this environment allows me not only to develop technical skills but also to gain experience working in teams on projects with high innovative potential.

My goal is to further expand my competencies in machine learning, deep learning, and data engineering, as well as to build projects that combine business value with modern technologies. I am characterized by curiosity, consistency, and a desire for continuous improvement – I believe that properly used data can become the foundation for better decisions and innovative solutions.

## 🚀 **My Projects**

### **[NalaGPT](nalagpt/index.md)**
NalaGPT is a simple chatbot application based on the OpenAI GPT-4o model, built with Streamlit. It allows users to chat with a bot that has a customizable personality (e.g., meows like a cat and asks for treats). The user can change the conversation name, chatbot personality, and manage multiple conversations, which are saved locally in JSON files.

**Key features:**

- Customizable chatbot personality
- Management of multiple conversations
- Conversation cost tracking (USD/PLN)
- Behavior personalization
- Local data storage

**Technologies:** `Streamlit` `OpenAI API` `dotenv` `JSON` `Pathlib` `Python`


### **[Iris Data Analysis](iris/index.md)**
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the classic Iris dataset. The project includes:
- Statistical summary and visualization of features (sepal/petal length and width)
- Class distribution and feature correlation analysis
- Outlier detection and comparison between species
- Visualizations: scatter plots, histograms, boxplots
This project demonstrates how to analyze and visualize biological data for classification tasks.


### **[Titanic Survival Prediction](titanic/index.md)**
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and survival prediction for Titanic passengers. The project covers:
- Data cleaning, missing value handling, and feature engineering
- Analysis of survival rates by gender, class, age, and family status
- Visualizations: class/age/fare distributions, survival by feature
- Preparation for machine learning modeling
This project provides insights into the main factors affecting survival and prepares the data for predictive modeling.

### **[🏃 Half Marathon Time Estimator](halfmaraton/index.md)**
An intelligent web application using machine learning to predict half marathon (21.097 km) completion time based on runner data. It combines advanced AI/ML technologies with a user-friendly interface.

**Key features:**

- Intelligent natural language processing (OpenAI GPT-3.5)
- Automatic ML model download from the cloud (Digital Ocean)
- Half marathon time prediction by Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Smart time format conversion
- Monitoring and metrics via Langfuse

**Technologies:** `Streamlit` `PyCaret` `OpenAI GPT-3.5` `Digital Ocean` `Langfuse` `Python`
